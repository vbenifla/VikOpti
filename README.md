# VikOpti

VikOpti is an open-source Python project for design optimization using different Genetic Algorithms (GA). It includes an efficient GA inspired by the optimization process described in [M. Hall. 2012. A Cumulative Multi-Niching Genetic Algorithm for Multimodal Function Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0751).
